# Music-generator
Generate music! And replace your music nerds in school!
## Note: This project is inactive. You may still contribute, but nuggetcat is working on something else
## Synopsis
Back when nuggetcat studies in a nicht-so-gut secondary school for his first two years, there was a cascade of music nerds. Nuggetcat tried his very best to play a piece of music on the recorder, namely F1 theme music, during its music exam. It turned out to be an earrape which was critisized by these music nerds. 
Pissed by those nerds, nuggetcat duplicated their brains into this program to replace them, with bots. Anyway, this paragraph was typed at midnight so its brain is not really functioning properly, why don't you read the instructions?

Keep in mind. I do not hate people who plays music, but people who brags crazily about it, get replaced by music-generator!! Begone thot :)

## Installation.

1. Open terminal
2. Install python by literally typing
```
python
```
(bruh)
3. Go to the directory
4. Install required items
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the file

## Notes
1. Wait for it to run! It took me 18 minutes to run the program once!!
2. Exe version lazy people, youre gonna have to wait longer than that.

## Additional

The Exe version of this software can be found in my personal google drive as there is a 25mB limit in Github. (They do be limiting our machine learning potentials innit?)
